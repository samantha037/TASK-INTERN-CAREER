        Generate_password(): that's where i created code that takes the userinput and creates a password then also checks that if you entered a length then the password that it creates should be the number of length you have entered like e.g 5 it will create a password that is 5 words
Generate_multiple_passwords(): I created a code that will take the userInput of how many passwords do you want to generate. So it will take the name, surname, length and create a certain number of passwords but they are different from each other. so if you enter 4 passwords it will creat 4 passwords that are different and have the details you entered on name and surname and how long your password should be
Check_password_strength(): This code deal with adding caracters like ?:+*&%$#@!, digits, uppercase and lowercase. When it adds these its making your password strong and no one can think of it.
<br>
Test_Project.py:
In this file I created tests for Generate_password, Generate_multiple_passwords and Check_passwords_strength. So i can test my program and see if I've done everything correct and with that I imported functions from projects.py to test them.

The reason why I chose this topic its because I looked at my daily life and I noticed that most of my passwords are too simple I mean anyone can guess them, so I used that opportunity to creat a program that will create a hard password that no one can guess and it should also meet the requirements needed when creating a password in places like websites, Social Media. I added check_password_strength so it can add digits/ numbers, uppercase/ lowercase and characters when generating your password making the password to be strong and can't easily be guessed by anyone. The great thing about this program is that it creates a password using your details like name, surname
